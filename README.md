# Selenium Bot for "Booking.com"

I've created this Selenium project to scrape the booking.com website and find the top 25 cheapest hotel names & prices of ratings 3, 4 & 5 as per the input from the user for location, desired date & # of people.

It's a very good project to understand OOPS & Selenium library uses.

This project is inspired by freeCodeCamp.org youtube channel.

If you've any questions, you can check the Selenium documentation page.
